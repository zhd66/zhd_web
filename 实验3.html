<div id="C_eva_content">
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quentin Tarantino's works always give people varying degrees of satisfaction from the perspective of watching the excitement or from the perspective of watching the profession. He is talented, familiar with all kinds of film languages and film types, but he has never been bound by any rules. His works are never perfect and always have sharp edges and corners. However, all kinds of high scenes can make fans experience unprecedented excitement and happiness. (commented by Hainan Daily) </p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Quentin Tarantino's works, stylized violence is everywhere. Although many films involve violence, no director is as addicted to it as he is. Quentin Tarantino's violence aesthetics inherits the banter and ritualization in clockwork orange and the truth and cruelty in taxi driver. On this basis, it gives new connotation and produces its own unique characteristics. Therefore, he led the trend of film violence aesthetics in the 1990s . (commented by new express)</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quentin Tarantino is good at telling stories in a non-linear way, expressing black humor in extreme ways, and deconstructing everything heartlessly. In his films, there is no great significance and no characters that need to be positively portrayed. If he can make the audience laugh, he will never have hypocritical pity for his characters. In addition, his techniques of segmenting the structure of the play from the viewpoint and using sound editing for story cohesion have had a far-reaching impact on the future films .
